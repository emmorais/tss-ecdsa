//! # High-level protocol description
//! The non-interactive signing protocol runs in two rounds:
//! - In the first round, parties calculate their share of a final signature
//!   using a fresh presign record and the message that should be signed. This
//!   value is then sent to all other parties.
//! - After receiving the shares from all other parties, the final signature is
//!   reconstructed and all parties verify its correctness. If the verification
//!   check passes, the signature is output.
