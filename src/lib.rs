//! # tss-ecdsa: A library for full-threshold ECDSA key generation and signing
//!
//! This work is based on the threshold ECDSA signature scheme originally
//! described by Canetti et al.[^cite], using `secp256k1`[^curve] as the
//! elliptic curve. The implementation is more limited than the original cited
//! protocol in several important ways:
//!
//! 1. It is full-threshold: _all_ participants holding a share of the private
//!    key must collaborate to produce a signature. There is some support for
//!    t-out-of-n key generation and the start of support for t-out-of-n key
//!    refresh but it is not complete.
//!
//! 2. Key refresh and aux-info are implemented separately from one another. At
//!    the moment, for security after compromise, you *must* run aux-info before
//!    key refresh.
//!
//! 3. It does not implement identifiable abort. That is, the protocol will
//!    abort if a party misbehaves, but we did not implement the procedures for
//!    identifying which party was responsible.
//!
//!
//! ## Background
//! In a threshold signature scheme, a set of participants derive an asymmetric
//! key pair such that each of them holds only a share of the private signing
//! key, corresponding to a single public verification key. To produce a
//! signature, a group of size at least `t` of the signers can collaborate to
//! produce a valid signature for a message, while any subset of `t-1` signers
//! will be unable to do so (or to forge a valid signature).
//!
//! With the cited threshold ECDSA protocol, signatures are validated by a
//! regular (non-threshold) ECDSA verification function.  In fact, signatures
//! generated in this threshold manner are indistinguishable from signatures
//! generated using a normal ECDSA signing method.
//!
//! # Usage
//! The [`Participant`] type is the main driver for protocol execution. A given
//! `Participant` is parameterized by the subprotocol that it runs:
//! [`keygen`](keygen::KeygenParticipant),
//! [`auxinfo`](auxinfo::AuxInfoParticipant),
//! [`keyrefresh`](keyrefresh::KeyrefreshParticipant),
//! [`tshare`](tshare::TshareParticipant),
//! [`presign`](presign::PresignParticipant),
//! [`sign`](sign::SignParticipant) or
//! [`interactive_sign`](sign::InteractiveSignParticipant).
//! As in the paper, interactive signing is equivalent to running presign and
//! sign back-to-back; you only have to generate one session ID and don't have
//! to handle secure storage of presign records, but don't get the benefit of
//! being able to "cache" message-independent records.
//!
//! A valid protocol run requires a lot of setup so we won't try to provide a
//! code example here; please see the examples directory. At a high level,
//! though, the user can run a protocol as follows:
//! 1. Create a new [`Participant`], parameterized by the
//!    [`ProtocolParticipant`] describing the protocol you want to run.
//! 2. Initialize the `Participant` by calling
//!    [`initialize_message()`](Participant::initialize_message()) and passing
//!    the result to
//!    [`process_single_message`](Participant::process_single_message()).
//! 3. Processing a message returns an optional output and a (possibly empty)
//!    set of messages. Send any messages to the other participants. If there's
//!    an output, the protocol is complete for this party.
//! 4. On receiving a message from another participant, call
//!    `process_single_message`. Repeat 3 and 4.
//!
//! Note that a `Participant` can receive messages before it has been
//! initialized. They will be stored and processed after initialization.
//!
//! # üîí Requirements of the calling application
//! This library **does not** implement the complete protocol. There are several
//! security-critical steps that must be handled by the calling application. We
//! leave these undone intentionally, to allow increased flexibility in
//! deploying the library, but this does mean that a successful, correct
//! deployment requires cryptographic expertise to advise on security of the
//! remaining components.
//!
//! These caller requirements are highlighted throughout the documentation with
//! the üîí symbol. At a high level, they include:
//!
//! 1. Networking. The protocol requires messages to be sent between the
//!    [`Participant`]s, but the library does not implement _any_ networking; it
//!    simply produces messages to be sent out. See [Networking
//!    section](#-networking) below for details, including properties that
//!    channels must maintain and validation that the calling application must
//!    do.
//!
//! 2. Secure persistent storage. The protocol is composed of subprotocols, each
//!    taking input and returning output. The calling application must persist
//!    outputs, provide them as input for subsequent protocol executions, and
//!    delete them at the end of their lifetimes. Some outputs are private
//!    values that must be stored securely. See [`Participant`] for more
//!    details.
//!
//! 3. Identifier creation. To create a [`Participant`], the calling application
//!    must specify a session [`Identifier`] and [`ParticipantIdentifier`]s for
//!    each party. We do not specify a protocol for creating these; depending on
//!    the trust assumptions of the deployment, the caller can select an
//!    appropriate protocol that will ensure that all parties agree on the set
//!    of identifiers. See [`Identifier`] and [`ParticipantIdentifier`] for more
//!    details. They must satisfy several properties:
//!     1. All identifiers must be consistent across all participants in a
//!        session.
//!     2. The session [`Identifier`] must be global and unique; in particular,
//!        it must not be reused across multiple protocol instances.
//!     3. The [`ParticipantIdentifier`]s must be unique within the session. A
//!        [`ParticipantIdentifier`] assigned to a specific entity can be reused
//!        across multiple session by that entity. They should not be reused for
//!        different real-world entities; we don't make any guarantees about
//!        system behavior when [`ParticipantIdentifier`]s are reused in this
//!        way.
//!
//! ## üîí Networking
//!
//! The calling application is responsible for sending messages between
//! participants in the protocol.
//! All communication between [`Participant`]s must take place over a
//! channel that satisfies sender authentication and integrity.
//! In practice, this is typically instantiated using a public key
//! infrastructure (PKI) to associate signing keys to entities.
//! Briefly, each message is accompanied by a signature on that message, under
//! the signing key associated with the sending entity.
//! Since the library does not deal directly with communication channels, it
//! does not validate that messages are correctly associated with their sender.
//!
//! Instead, the calling application is responsible for maintaining a mapping
//! between the [`ParticipantIdentifier`] and the signing key associated with
//! each entity. [`Message`](messages::Message)s contain a `from:
//! ParticipantIdentifier` field which specifies the sender of a message. On
//! receiving a message and signature over a channel, the calling application
//! must check that the `from` field in the message matches the signing key used
//! to generate the signature. This ensures that the sender is not lying about
//! its identity.
//!
//! The protocol requires a UC-secure, synchronous, authenticated broadcast
//! channel for use by the [`Participant`]s. Currently, the library handles this
//! automatically by implementing the echo-broadcast protocol described by
//! Goldwasser and Lindell[^echo]. This is the approach the paper mentions,
//! but we emphasize that this reduces the security of the protocol to selective
//! abort[^abort] rather than the stronger notion of identifiable abort that is
//! achieved with an authenticated broadcast protocol.
//!
//!
//! # ‚ö†Ô∏è Security warning
//! The implementation in this crate has not been independently audited for
//! security! We have also not released a version that we have finished
//! internally auditing.
//!
//! At this time, we do not recommend use for security-critical applications.
//! Use at your own risk.
//!
//! # Useful features
//!
//! A [`Participant`] processes messages received from other [`Participant`]s
//! and generates [`Message`](messages::Message) for other  [`Participant`]s to
//! process. When the current sub-protocol finishes, output values are produced.
//!
//! Messages may arrive from the network before a [`Participant`] is ready to
//! process them. [`Participant`]s can be given messages at any time; when
//! messages are received early, they are stored in memory by the library and
//! retrieved and processed at the appropriate time.
//!
//! A sub-protocol session automatically progresses between rounds; the calling
//! application does not have to track where within a session the protocol
//! execution is at a given time.
//!
//! # Update to CGGMP
//! Note that the most recent version of the [CGGMP paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060.pdf) on
//! Eprint has made significant departures from the original protocols
//! presented in 2020. Since most of the protocols we use are those described
//! in the original paper, every other link in this crate redirects to that
//! version.

//! [^abort]: In a protocol that offers identifiable abort,
//! malicious participants may cause the protocol to abort but
//! honest participants are able to identify the malicious party (and take
//! recovery actions). In a protocol that offers selective abort, malicious
//! participants may cause _some_ honest participants to abort, but any
//! non-aborting honest participants have the correct output. This is weaker
//! because honest parties do not identify malicious parties and there is
//! inconsistency across honest parties on whether an abort happened or not.
