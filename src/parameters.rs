//! Security parameter definitions.
//!
//! This module defines security parameters that ensure the protocol satisfies
//! 80-bit statistical security and 112-bit computational security (the paper
//! claims 128-bit computational security, but NIST's Recommendation for Key
//! Management \[1\] advises that a 2048-bit Paillier modulus only provides 112
//! bits of computational security).
//!
//! Values are sourced from throughout the paper \[2\], especially Figure 1
//! (page 5) and Table 2 (page 69).
